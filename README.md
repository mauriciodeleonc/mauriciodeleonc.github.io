# Disney - Take-Home Coding Assignment
## Overview
Welcome!

This repository contains a backup copy of my original submission for the Disney - Living Room Devices Client Engineering: Interview Candidate Assignment.
The original submission was created using [this Code Sandbox](https://codesandbox.io/p/sandbox/th6htc) and submitted on January 16 2025. Due to issues with the submission email, Iâ€™ve also hosted the project on GitHub Pages to ensure easy access for the team.

Thank you for taking the time to review my work!

## Tech Stack
This submission was built using the following technologies:
- HTML
- JavaScript
- CSS

## Future Improvements
- Use a framework or library like React to help encapsulate logic and create components.
- Add skeleton while data is being fetched for better UX.
- Improve fallback for when an assets aren't loading correctly (i.e. push them to the end of the list / collection, that way users wonâ€™t see issues right when loading the page).
- Improve css to respond to different media queries accordingly.
- Implement or use a list virtualization package for improving website performance.
- Add testing (UI, unit, integration) on different devices and / or browsers.
- Understand compatibility with the devices users typically use, their performance limits, and adjust code accordingly.
- Add internationalization for different languages.
- Fully nderstand the API response to improve how data is processed in the front end. Functions could be reduced / improved if I had a better understanding of how to expect the data (maybe access to something like swagger).
